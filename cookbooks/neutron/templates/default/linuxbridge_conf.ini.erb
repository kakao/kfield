# (StrOpt) Type of network to allocate for tenant networks. The

# networks to provide connectivity between hosts. Set to 'none' to

# of VLAN IDs on named physical networks that are available for
# allocation. All physical networks listed are available for flat and
# VLAN provider network creation. Specified ranges of VLAN IDs are
